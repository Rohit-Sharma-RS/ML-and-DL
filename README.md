# 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to the **ML & DL Projects Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of Python notebooks and scripts covering everything from fundamental machine learning algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures and LLM fine-tuning.

We’re participating in **Hacktoberfest**, so if you’re looking for beginner-friendly but meaningful issues, you’re in the right place.  
Check out the [`CONTRIBUTIONS.md`](./CONTRIBUTIONS.md) to see the community of contributors.
